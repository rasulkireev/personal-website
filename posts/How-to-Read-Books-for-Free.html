      <p>This part of the article is an apology to authors. The “meat” of the post is a little further down the line. However, I do encourage you to read this part.</p>

      <p>This post will provide a real step-by-step tutorial on how to download and read digital books for free (not crappy books, but the good staff). This means that the money stay in your pocket and does not go to the publisher and hece does not go to the author and that is bad! Authors put a lot of hours, a lot of work in the final product and it is slightly unfair to leave them without any financial reward for their work. </p>
      <p>On the other hand, how many times did it happen to you that you have purchased a book and it turned out to be a total waste of time and money. Note: It happened to me a lot. Which is kind of demoralizing.</p>
      <p>So, what I propose, is that you use my guide to download a book for free and once you read it decide whether the author has provided any value to you. Even if the book has provided you with 1-2 good thought while reading it, consider it good value! If you decide that value has been provided and the book was good, <strong>buy the book</strong>! <strong>Please,</strong> <strong>buy the book! </strong>Or at least donate some money to author, he/she deserved it.</p>
      <p>Authors! Thank you so much for your thoughts, your research, your work and your wisdom, we really appreciate it!</p>

      <p>If you are good with tech, here is just a list of super-duper-mega cool resources that you can use to download books for free. You don’t need to read the rest of this guide.</p>

      <p>If you run into a problem while on one of this sites please read the steps below.</p>


      <p><strong><a href="http://LIBGEN.IS" target="_blank">LIBGEN.IS</a></strong></p>
      <p>This is by far my favourite website! I can find almost any book here. I prefer to read books in epub format (convert to azw3 and import to my Kindle).</p>

      <ol><li>Go to <a href="http://libgen.is" target="_blank">libgen.is</a></li>
      <li>In the search bar, type in the books you are looking for.</li></ol>
      <p><blockquote>Note: I suggest first finding the book on amazon, to copy the exact title (or the first couple of words from the title).</blockquote></p>
      <p>      3.   Press Search </p>
      <p><blockquote>Note: after I’ve got my results (assuming that I did) I like to sort by year (by pressing on the year button), so that I can see the latest edition available.</blockquote></p>
      <p>      4. Now you just need to find the file with the extension that you need. (Extension column)</p>
      <p><blockquote>Note: There you can see PDFs, EPUBs, MOBI, AZW3. You will most likely need a PDF or an EPUB. Even if you are looking to import your book to a KINDLE, you can easily convert EPUB to AZW3, which KINDLE uses. (I’ll talk about converting books and importing them to KINDLE in a different article.)</blockquote></p>
      <p>       5. Once you found the book you’ve been looking for you can just press on on of the numbers in the square brackets [] (mirrors - fancy word for links). Or you can press the link of the book (the name itself), which will lead you to a page where you can choose the mirror in more detail.</p>
      <p>       6. Usually the only thing left to do is to press “Get” or “Download”. Sometimes, certain mirrors will require some additional step (nothing serious).</p>

      <p>That’s it. Now you a have a book file on your computer (or phone) and you can read it. For free! Just don’t forget to buy the book if you liked it. Chances are you’ll want to read it again. </p>

      <p>If there is something you don’t understand, just shoot me an email and I’ll try to give you some more information.</p>
