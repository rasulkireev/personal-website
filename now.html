    <h3>The art of trying to do everything at once!</h3>
    <small>Inspired by Derek Sivers</small>

      I remembered that my sister used to take photography classes many years ago and her camera (Sony Alpha330) is seating at her place unused. Can't remember when (recent) and how, but I got this urge to learn the basics of photography. I think one of the reasons I wanted to try myself in photography (as well as just learn a new, exciting and interesting skill) was to see if there is a big advantage over the regular smartphone cameras.
      <br>I am now reading the most popular book on phography and exposure "insert affiliate link for Understanding Exposure" and trying to make photos whenever I am outside. I am lucky to have my wife as my model, so I can practice both landscape and portrait photography. All photos are done in manual setting and I already see that it is harder than I thought before.
      <br>I hope to soon start publishing my photos here on my personal website. 
      <br>I also hope my wife will help me with some o the editing.
      </li>

      I have just grasped the basics of HTML & CSS, by making this personal website. I now want to learn more advanced skills. More specifically, I want to learn how to use JavaScript, MySQL (or other database) to create a more dynamic website. I hope to perefct those skills while working on a art selling website (which is a next point).

      <li>Working on a BI (PowerBI) dashboard for Guy Carpenter, to track hours worked and revenue generated.
        <br><em>This will help analyze large datasets to come up with informed strategic decisions.</em></li>
      <li>Writing a guide for international students to help them find good work. Guide inicludes actionable advice I was not given as a student.
        <br><em>I hope this will be very useful.</em></li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Socializing</h3>
    <p>Finding new people to meet on LinkedIn.
    <br>Great resource for finding interesting and like-minded people.</p>

    <h3>Trying to find balance and security</h3>
    <p>Live with my wife in Newark, NJ. Somewhat difficult to live on a interns salary, so constantly trying to find new ways to earn money. Working really hard to create a side hustle for stable income.
      <br>Meanwhile trying to find the balance between work and family<p>
    <p>One does not simply ignore his wife for days.
      <br><em>Deadly mistake!</em></p>
