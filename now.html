    <h1 class="small">What I'm doing now.</h1>
    <h3 class="small">The art of trying to do too much!</h3>
    <small>Inspired by Derek Sivers</small>
    <small>This page was updated on June 10th, 2019</small>

    <p>I currently live in Newark, NJ with my beautiful wife. We are from Russia, and live in USA temporarily, while I work at Guy Carpenter as Data Analyst and try to gain relevant experience in the Analytics field. We try to enjoy every moment of our lives.</p>
    <p>Here are the things I am currently working on:</p>

    <ul class="now-list">
      <li class="now-bullet">
      <h3 class="subheading">Wokring on a Data Science Project</h3>
      I am somewhat familiar with Python and some of its main libraries for Data Analysis (pandas, numpy, scikit and others). I never got a chance to use those in a meaningful way. I am in the search for an interesting dataset (I think I found one about International Students in the USA) to analyze and present in a blog format. I wanted to transition to Data Science career now for a while and this is a good thing to do, both for my personal and professional growth.
      </li>

      <h3 class="subheading">Learning Front-End Development</h3>
      <li class="now">
      I have just grasped the basics of HTML & CSS, by making this personal website. I now want to learn more advanced skills. More specifically, I want to learn how to use JavaScript, MySQL (or other database) to create a more dynamic website. I hope to perefct those skills while working on a art selling website (which is a next point).
      </li>

      <li class="now">
      <h3 class="subheading">Creating Art Marketplace (Russia)</h3>
      I working on building a website where artists can sell their work. There are not many site like this in the market I will work with, (Moscow, Russia). This is not a new idea, so I don't expect it to be very profitable, but it is something I would enjoy doing and at the same time is a good way to learn more advanced web development techniques. I will charge the artist to display the artwork on the website, as well as a small percentage from every sell made. Kind of similar (exact) pricing strategy of early CDBaby.
      </li>

      <li class="now">
      <h3 class="subheading">Learning Photography</h3>
      I remembered that my sister used to take photography classes many years ago and her camera (Sony Alpha330) is seating at her place unused. Can't remember when (recent) and how, but I got this urge to learn the basics of photography. I think one of the reasons I wanted to try myself in photography (as well as just learn a new, exciting and interesting skill) was to see if there is a big advantage over the regular smartphone cameras.
      <br>I am now reading the most popular book on phography and exposure <a href="https://amzn.to/2F2sDYF">Understanding Exposure</a> and trying to make photos whenever I am outside. I am lucky to have my wife as my model, so I can practice both landscape and portrait photography. All photos are done in manual setting and I already see that it is harder than I thought before.
      <br>I hope to soon start publishing my photos here on my personal website.
      <br>I also hope my wife will help me with some of the editing.
      </li>

      <li class="now">
      <h3 class="subheading">Creating Business Intelligence Reports</h3>
      Working on a BI (PowerBI) dashboard for Guy Carpenter, provide feasible and visually appealing dashboard for the clients to use. People don't generally do well with numbers, let alone probability table. This is an attempt to make an easy to read, interactive presentation. This will help my company to have a competitive advantage over other reinsurance brokers and help win clients.
      </li>

      <li class="now">
      <h3 class="subheading">Writing Info Product for International Students</h3>
      Currently in the process of writing a guide for international students to help them find good work. Guide includes actionable advice I was not given as a student. I try to include easy to understand guides on networking, website creation, resume building and other things that will help students get an edge over their peers.
      <br><i>I hope this will be very useful.</i>
      </li>

      <li class="now">
      <h3 class="subheading">Socializing</h3>
      <p>
      I am constantly trying to connect with new people. I use LinkedIn a lot for this purpose. I feel like it is a great resource for finding interesting and like-minded people.
      </p>
      </li>

      <li class="now">
      <h3 class="subheading">Trying to find balance, financial security and general calmness.</h3>
      <p>Currently living with my wife in Newark, NJ. Somewhat difficult to live on a interns salary, so constantly trying to find new ways to earn money. Working really hard to create a side hustle for stable income. At the same time, trying not to forget about marital duties.
      <br>One does not simply ignore his wife for days.
      <br><i>Deadly mistake!</i></p>
