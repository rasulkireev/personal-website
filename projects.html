      <h1>Projects</h1>
      <hr>
      <p>Only recently have I discovered how easy and cheap it is to purchase a domain and hosting for it. That meant, all the ideas I ever had are now much easier to implement. With a little bit of knowledge in WordPress or plain HTML&CSS you could quickly design a website for your idea and start getting feedback straight away. These are by no means are ideal or perfect, but I am proud that I was able to create these. I hope to continue working on these projects for a long time or even create more, as ideas come.
      <p>If you have any question just shoot me an email at <a href="mailto:kireevr1996@gmail.com">kireevr1996@gmail.com</a></p>
      <p>So, here is the list of projects I have worked on or am currently working on:</p>


      <div>
      <a href="https://rasulkireev.com/" target="_blank"><h3>My Personal Website</h3></a>
        <p>
          You are currently looking at this site. It might be weird talking about portfolio website as a project, but I certainly consider it one. I built this website from scratch using <strong>HTML&CSS</strong> together with <strong>Jekyll</strong> and am hosting it on <strong>GitHubPages</strong>. I am proud of my work and hope to continually improve it as time goes by.
       </p>

      <div>
      <a href="https://yourguidestolife.com/" target="_blank"><h3>Your Guides to Life</h3></a>
        <p>
          This website/blog was my attempt to create an action packed list of guides that might be useful in life. Categories include, finance, investment, health, food and many others. Site gets continually updated and slowly builds up its own audience.
       </p>
      <div>

      <div>
      <a href="https://osarjournal.com/" target="_blank"><h3>OSAR Journal</h3></a>
        <p>
          Students write millions of academic papers each year, whether for their own interest (minority) or for a class project and a large percentage of these works sit there on their hard drive, unused. I want to create a community where people (current students and graduates) will share their best research work for the whole world to see. My hope is that with more research papers out there in the web (for free, OSAR stands for Open Source Analytics Research) we will increase the flow of knowledge and increase the rate of innovation and discovery.
